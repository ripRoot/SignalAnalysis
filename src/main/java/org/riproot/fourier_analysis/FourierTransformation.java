     * The interpretation of the DFT is that the vector x represents the signal level at various points in time.
     * The vector X represents the signal level at various frequencies.
     * The formula outlines that the signal level at frequency k is equal to the sum of the 
     * signal level at each time t multiplied by a complex exponential.
     * 
     * 
     * The output of a Fourier Transformation is called a frequency spectrum, which contains a series of complex numbers where each number 
     * corresponds to a specific frequnecy and provides information about it's amplitude. (How much of that frequency is present) and phase 
     * (The offset of the frequency's waveform). Each output is in the form a + jb.    
     * 
     * After implementing it myself, I will move to the Apache Commons Math FFT. 
     * 
     * This will be part of a larger project called ASR. 
     * 
     * Pretty much I will:
     * 
     * Preprocess the audio (remove noise, normalize it)
     * 
     * Frame-Blocking (divide audio into short, overlapping timeframes)
     * 
     * Compute a FFT
     * 
     * Extract Features
     * 
     * Use a language model to convert the sequence into phonemes into recognizable words and sentances.
