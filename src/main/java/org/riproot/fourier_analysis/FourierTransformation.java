     * The interpretation of the DFT is that the vector x represents the signal level at various points in time.
     * The vector X represents the signal level at various frequencies.
     * The formula outlines that the signal level at frequency k is equal to the sum of the 
     * signal level at each time t multiplied by a complex exponential.
     * 
     * 
     * The output of a Fourier Transformation is called a frequency spectrum, which contains a series of complex numbers where each number 
     * corresponds to a specific frequnecy and provides information about it's amplitude. (How much of that frequency is present) and phase 
     * (The offset of the frequency's waveform). Each output is in the form a + jb.
